# Eclipse Movie Data Base [ECDB]
This is the second assignment for Algorithms module as part of Applied Computing in the WIT.

This assignment is the development of a Movie recommender using existing movie data.

### Aims
  - Load existing movie, user and rating data into a Java program
  - Develop a suitable data serializer
  - Create a suitable API to view and manipulate movie, user and rating data
  - Make movie recommendation for user
  - Provie unit testing which provides adequate code coverage and users C.O.R.R.E.C.T. and Right B.I.C.E.P guidelines


### Movie Data

The data used has been adapted from the [MovieLens site][df1].
This data has been broken into two sets, a small set for testing and building and a larger set for finished product.

### Extra Libraries Used

EMDB uses a number of libraries to work properly:

* [Cliche Shell] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Guava] - awesome web-based text editor
* [Princton Standard Library] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [Xstream] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps

### Expected Code
- Abstract data types
- Comparisons
- Arrays/Lists/Maps
- Modular programming
- Strandard libraries
- Reading from and writing to files
- Searching
- Sorting
 
### Features
Some of the features of this app include:
-Adding/Removing Users
-Adding/Removing Movies
-Adding/Removing Ratings
-Searching Users/Movies/Ratings
-Getting Recommendations
